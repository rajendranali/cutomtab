# Custom Browser Tabs

Custom Browser Tabs is a simple web application that allows users to dynamically create and manage browser tabs, enter URLs to load content in iframes, and switch between tabs seamlessly. This project encourages creativity in enhancing the user interface and experience while providing a flexible and intuitive tab management system.

## Features

- **Tab Creation and Closing**: Users can easily create new tabs by clicking on the "+" button. Each tab includes a close button for convenient removal.
- **URL Input and Content Loading**: Tabs come equipped with an input field where users can enter URLs. Pressing Enter loads the corresponding content into an iframe within the tab.
- **Tab Switching**: Users can switch between tabs by clicking on them, allowing for quick navigation between different web pages.
